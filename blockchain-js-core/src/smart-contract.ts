/**
 * This should implement basic smart contract functionality :
 * 
 * - recognize and sort-up data in the blockchain (only those with certain field values, and which are consistent...)
 * - has its own data-structure
 * 
 * - stores programs with an id, author's pubKey and a code in js (maybe list of parameters etc)
 * - can instantiate a program = allocating memory and initial parameters for an execution of it
 * - the program has : execution, memory and i/o model
 * - execution is js and is sandboxed. Also a basic block navigation API is provided
 * - memory is js (memory is ephemeral and dies after the call)
 * - i/o is :
 *   - inputs : program instance data, call parameters and blocks, 
 *   - outputs : add data to the chain => yes as long as idempotent => produced data must keyed by the smart contract (and of course it cannot use random number generation)
 * - allows to get data that should be added in the chain to call a program
 * 
 * - signed calls : sig(pubKey, programInstanceId, parameters)
 * 
 * - allows to update a program by signing its previous version with the same private key
 * 
 * - program api: create update delete, options : can instances be created without a sig ?
 * - instance api: lifecycle=init_memory, methods
 * 
 * Think about key renewal...
