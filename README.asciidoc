= Blockchain demo

Aim is to create a naive blockchain implementation to make others understands what is going on with that thing.

This program maintains a distributed database accross nodes.

Traditionnal blockchain implemented concepts :

- block chain (data is a list of blocks)
- proof of work (proof of stake when i will myself understand the crux of it)

The idea is that the database maintained by the nodes is a "data-registry" (more to be said on it later) ... Where one can store key-value pairs where value can be any JSON type (primitive, object or array).
